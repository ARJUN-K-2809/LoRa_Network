        <h4 class="section-title">About the Project</h4>
        <p>
            This project focuses on building a LoRa-based real-time elephant monitoring system aimed at minimizing human-elephant conflict in forest-adjacent regions. It integrates long-range wireless communication, environmental sensing, and live data dashboards to deliver alerts and insights. The system was conceptualized and developed as part of the OELP to create an impactful technological solution for real-world ecological challenges.
